## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-13

The first usable single-agent release, distributed on PyPI as `agentframe-py`
and imported as `agentframe`.

### Added

- **Authoring:** `Agent` subclasses with `@agent` identity and one async
  `@skill` method per advertised skill; Python types and Pydantic models as
  validated input and output contracts; `Inject[T]` services registered with
  `Services.add` / `add_scoped`; per-invocation `RunContext`.
- **Local runtime:** `Runtime.invoke` returns a validated value and
  `Runtime.run` a `RunResult` with invocation ID, usage, model and tool calls,
  duration and finish reason. `RunLimits`, `ModelSettings` and `RunOptions`
  resolve field by field from library to agent, skill and run.
- **A2A 1.0 hosting:** `AgentApp` serves a generated native Agent Card and a
  JSON-RPC endpoint through the official `a2a-sdk`. Structured requests name a
  skill through the Agent Card's skill-call extension; free text uses a custom
  `SkillRouter` or the opt-in `ModelRouter`, which asks back with
  `TASK_STATE_INPUT_REQUIRED` when a request is ambiguous.
  `agentframe run module:create_app` serves an application (`server` extra).
- **Models:** `OllamaModel` (local Llama, `ollama` extra) and `FoundryModel`
  (Microsoft Foundry GPT deployments, `foundry` extra), switched by
  configuration only. One `ctx.generate` returns text, a validated Pydantic
  instance with `output=`, or runs registered `@tool` functions with
  `tools=[...]` within `max_tool_calls`. Refusal, truncation and unsupported
  capabilities raise typed errors. `ScriptedModel` in `agentframe.testing`
  scripts model replies for tests.
- **Security:** `HostConfig(auth=...)` with `APIKeyAuth`, `EntraIDAuth`
  (`entra` extra), explicit `AllowAnonymous` or a custom `Authenticator`;
  skill `requires_permissions`, role mapping and an injected
  `AuthorizationPolicy`, failing closed; optional `ExecutionPolicy` input,
  model-request, tool and output checks.
- **Hardening:** host ceilings for concurrent runs, request and response size,
  and graceful shutdown; `/health` and `/ready`; A2A message deduplication by
  caller and message ID; safe, correlated errors with redacted operator logs.
- **Examples:** runnable examples in `examples/`, each checked against the
  installed wheel by `python -m examples.smoke`.
