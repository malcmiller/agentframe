        """Generate text, or a validated ``output`` instance, with the agent's model.

        The agent's ``instructions`` and then ``instructions`` are sent as
        trusted ``system`` messages; ``text`` is sent as a separate ``user``
        message and never merged into them. Keeping them separate does not
        guarantee resistance to prompt injection.

        Args:
            text: Untrusted content for the model, such as caller input.
            instructions: Trusted instructions for this call only. Never put
                untrusted content here.
            output: A Pydantic ``BaseModel`` subclass. When given, the model
                is asked for JSON matching its schema and the reply is
                validated into an instance. Invalid output is never repaired
                or re-requested.
            tools: ``@tool`` functions to offer the model, each registered on
                the agent and selected once. Omitted or empty offers no
                tools; registered tools are never offered unless selected
                here. The model's tool calls run one at a time, in its
                order, and their results are sent back until it answers.
                A call naming a tool that was not offered, or with invalid
                arguments, runs nothing; the model is told what was wrong.

        Returns:
            The model's complete answer, or an ``output`` instance when
            ``output`` is given. With tools, the answer after the tool calls.

        Raises:
            DefinitionError: ``output`` is not a ``BaseModel`` subclass, or is
                a ``RootModel``, or a selected tool is not registered on the
                agent or is selected twice. Raised before anything is sent.
            UnsupportedCapabilityError: The agent has no model configured, or
                the model lacks something the request needs, such as
                structured output or tool calling. Raised before anything is
                sent.
            OutputValidationError: The structured reply is not valid JSON or
                does not match ``output``, or a tool returned a value that
                does not match its return annotation.
            ModelRefusalError: The model refused, or a content filter blocked
                its output.
            IncompleteOutputError: The output was cut short at the token
                limit or was empty. Partial text or objects are never returned;
                for text cut short at the limit, the error's ``partial_text``
                holds what arrived, and a skill may catch it and use it.
            ProviderError: The model provider call failed.
            LimitExceededError: A model call does not fit the run's limits,
                the run has made ``max_tool_calls`` tool calls, or the run's
                timeout expired during a model or tool call.

        Exceptions raised by a tool propagate unchanged and fail the run;
        their text is never sent to the model.
