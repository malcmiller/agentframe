    """Deployment settings for a remotely hosted agent.

    Resource ceilings, admission limits and shutdown settings come later (M7).

    Args:
        public_url: The origin callers use to reach the agent, for example
            ``"https://echo.example.com"``. It is advertised on the Agent Card;
            it is not the address the server binds to.
        auth: How remote callers are authenticated. There is no default: use
            ``AllowAnonymous()`` to accept anonymous callers explicitly.
        role_permissions: Maps each verified role to the permissions it grants,
            for example ``{"Editor": ["documents:write"]}``. A caller's
            permissions are the union over its roles; unknown roles grant
            nothing. Stored read-only.

    Raises:
        DefinitionError: ``auth`` is ``None``; ``public_url`` is not an
            absolute http(s) URL, or it contains credentials, a query or a
            fragment; or a ``role_permissions`` value is a single string
            instead of a list.
